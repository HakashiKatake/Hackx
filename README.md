Welcome aboard the Straw-Hats project! We're a crew of developers who navigated the HackX3.0 Hackathon, and this repository is the treasure map to our creation. Built with a blend of TypeScript, Python for AI, NextJS, AR made from Snapchat's AR Studio and a dash of ingenuity, we hope you find our project both interesting and useful.  Get ready to set sail! 🏴‍☠️

## 🗺️ Project Overview

Straw-Hats is a project forged from a diverse tech stack. Here's a glimpse at the ingredients that make up our concoction:

*   **TypeScript:** - The backbone of our application, providing type safety and a smooth development experience.
*   **Python:** - Adding some scripting magic and data-handling capabilities.
*   **Other:** - A sprinkle of other technologies to tie everything together!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to hoist the sails and get this project running? Follow these simple steps:

This project utilizes Next.js.  If you're unfamiliar, it's a fantastic React framework for building performant web applications.

### 🛠️ Development Server

To fire up the development server, use one of the following commands in your terminal:

npm run dev

or
yarn dev

or
pnpm dev

or
bun dev


Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the magic unfold! ✨

Feel free to dive into the code and start tinkering! You can begin by modifying `app/page.tsx` – the page auto-updates as you make changes, making development a breeze.
